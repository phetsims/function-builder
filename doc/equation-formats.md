Function Builder - equation formats
=============

**Notes**

This specification is referenced in the documentation of `HelpfulEquation`, `HelpfulEquationNode`,
`SlopeInterceptEquation` and `SlopeInterceptEquationNode`. To understand those types, you'll want to be familiar with
this specification.

The "helpful" format was arrived at via consensus at design meetings. It is PhET-specific, and does not correspond to a
standard mathematical format. The intent is to create a clear association with the functions that are in the builder,
and provide a "bridge" to the slope-intercept format. The term "helpful" is (thankfully) never shown to the sim user.

The "slope-intercept" format is the standard `y = mx + b` format, where `m = rise/run` and `b` is the y intercept.

Cards show the right-hand side of the slope-intercept equation. Eg, if the slope-intercept form is `y = 2x + 2`, then
the "x" card in the input carousel will show `2x + 2` in the output carousel.

Square brackets '[ ]' shown in the examples will not be rendered. They are used to indicate a numerator in this
specification. The forward slash '/' shown in the examples will be rendered as a horizontal line separating numerator
and denominator. For example, `'[x + 3]/2'` is rendered as:

**Rules**

Rules for generating "helpful" format:

(1) Adjacent addition and subtraction operations are collapsed, e.g.: `+ 3 - 2 → x + 1`. If they collapse to zero, then
the operations are dropped entirely, e.g.: `* 2 + 3 - 3 → 2x`

(2) Adjacent multiplication operations are collapsed, e.g.: `* 2 * 3 → 6x`.

(3) Multiplication by 1 is shown, e.g.: `* 1 → 1x`, `+ 2 * 1 → 1(x + 2)`

(4) Multiplication by 0 is shown, e.g.: `* 0 → 0x`, `+ 2 * 0 → 0(x + 2)`

(5) If the portion of the equation preceding multiplication contains one or more operators, then it is wrapped in
parentheses, e.g.: `- 3 * 2 → 2(x-3)`

(6) Adjacent division operations are collapsed, e.g.: `/ 3 / 2 → x/6`

(7) Division by 1 is shown, e.g.: `/ 1 → x/1`, `* 2 / 1 → [2x]/1`

(8) Division by 0 is not allowed.

(9) The portion of the equation preceding division is treated as a numerator, e.g.: `+ 1 / 3 → [x + 1]/3`
