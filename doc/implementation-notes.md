# Function Builder - implementation notes

This document contains miscellaneous notes related to the implementation of Function Builder. It supplements the
internal (source code) documentation, and (hopefully) provides insight into
"big picture" implementation issues. The audience for this document is software developers who are familiar with
JavaScript and PhET simulation development (as described in [PhET Development Overview]
(https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-development-overview.md)).

First, read [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/doc/model.md), which provides a high-level
description of the simulation model.

## Terminology

This section enumerates terms that you'll see used throughout the internal and external documentation. In alphabetical
order:

* builder - the apparatus in the center of the screen
* cards - the things in the input and output carousel, that you drag through the builder
* challenge - a series of 1 or more functions in Mystery screen's builder. The user's tasks is to guess the function(s)
  in the challenge.
* container - an item in a carousel, which contains cards or functions
* drawers - things that slide out of the top & bottom of the builder, to reveal additional representations
* functions - the things in the functions carousel, that you drag into slots in the builder
* function carousel - horizontal carousel at bottom of screen
* generate button - the yellow button centered below the builder in the Mystery screen. Pressing it selects a challenge
  randomly from the pool.
* input carousel - vertical carousel on the left side of the screen
* output carousel - vertical carousel on the right side of the screen
* reveal buttons - toggle buttons below the functions in the Mystery screen (they have eyeball icons on them). Pressing
  a reveal button shows/hides the identity of the function directly above it. These buttons are initially disabled for a
  challenge. They are enabled when the output carousel contains 3 cards, and they remain enabled until a new challenge
  is generated.
* scene - a builder, set of cards and set of functions. Each screen has 1 or more scenes
* "see inside" windows - windows that appear in the builder to display intermediate results
* slots - places where you can drop functions in the builder

## General

This section describes how this simulation uses patterns that are common to most PhET simulations.

**Model-view transform**: Many PhET simulations have a model-view transform that maps between model and view coordinate
frames. The domain of this simulation has no need for a model coordinate frame, so the model and view coordinate frames
are treated as equivalent, and no transform is required. (If you don't understand that, don't worry about it.)

**Query parameters**: Query parameters are used to enable sim-specific features, mainly for debugging and testing. All
such query parameters are documented in
[FBQueryParameters](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/FBQueryParameters.js).

**Memory management**: All objects created in this simulation exist for the lifetime of the simulation, so there is no
need to call `dispose`. Since there is no need to call `dispose`, it is generally not implemented for sim-specific
types. Likewise, when an observer is registered (e.g. via `link` or `addListener`), there is no need to unregister that
observer (e.g. via `unlink` or `removeListener`). For clarity, all calls that register an observer indicate whether a
corresponding unregister call is required. For example:

```js
// unlink unnecessary, instances exist for lifetime of the sim
movable.positionProperty.link( ... );
```

## Model

This section provides an overview of the most important model elements, and some miscellaneous topics related to the
model.

[FBMovable](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/FBMovable.js)
is the base type for anything that can be moved (ie, cards and functions). It is responsible for an object's location
and animation to a desired location.

[Card](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/cards/Card.js)
and its subtypes implement the card model. Cards provide the input to the builder, but have no responsibility for what
is displayed on them. What is actually displayed on a card is the responsibility of the view (see
[CardNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/cards/CardNode.js)
and its subtypes).

[AbstractFunction](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/functions/AbstractFunction.js)
and its subtypes implement the function model. The function model is responsible for applying the function to an input
and producing an output. For programming convenience, it also carries some view-specific information
(e.g., the color of the function's background, the icon to display on the function to identify it). For invertible
functions, an explicit inverse function is not implemented. Instead, all computations are performed in the forward
direction, based on an input's location relative to a function. A card's location is constrained based on whether a
function is invertible; cards cannot be dragged backwards through non-invertible functions.

There are two primary types of functions:

* image functions: These functions perform an image transform using Canvas. See
  [ImageFunction](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/functions/ImageFunction.js)
  and its subtypes.
* numeric functions: These functions perform mathematical functions using rational numbers. See
  [MathFunction](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/functions/MathFunction.js)
  and its subtypes.

[RationalNumber](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/RationalNumber.js)
implements support for rational numbers. This is a thin wrapper around the 3rd-party library
[BigRational.js](https://github.com/peterolson/BigRational.js). It exposes only the functionality required for this
simulation, so is not likely to be useful in other simulations.

[Builder](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/builder/Builder.js)
and its subtypes implement the builder model. It is responsible for managing the functions in its slots, and applying
those functions to cards. For programming convenience, it also carries some view-specific information
(e.g., the builder's dimensions, the color scheme applied to the builder).

[Scene](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/Scene.js)
and its subtypes implement a specific configuration that is to be displayed to the user. The model for each screen
contains one or more scenes. A scene consists of a builder, a set of cards, and a set of functions. Subtypes of Scene
add additional elements to the basic scene. For example,
[MysteryScene](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/mystery/model/MysteryScene.js)
adds a pool of challenges for the "Mystery" screen.

**Two-phase model initialization**: Most PhET simulations create a model, then a corresponding view. This simulation is
a bit different; the model cannot be fully instantiated without creating the view. The initial location of cards and
functions is their location in their respective carousels, which are view components. So we cannot create cards and
functions until their carousels are created. Initialization of this simulation's model therefore occurs in 2 phases. In
the first phase, scenes are created without cards and functions. The view is then initialized, which creates the
carousels. In the second phase, the scenes are then populated with cards and functions. To investigate this further, see
`completeInitialization` in
[SceneNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/SceneNode.js).

## View

This section provides an overview of the most important view components, and some miscellaneous topics related to the
view.

[MovableNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/MovableNode.js)
is the base type for all nodes that move or animate (i.e., cards and functions).

[CardNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/cards/CardNode.js)
and its subtypes are responsible for what appears on the cards, based on their location relative to the functions in the
builder. CardNode encapsulates all drag handling and animation behavior for cards.

[FunctionNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/functions/FunctionNode.js)
and its subtypes implement the view of functions. FunctionNode encapsulates all drag handling and animation behavior for
functions.

[BuilderNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/builder/BuilderNode.js)
implements the view of the builder, with a pseudo-3D perspective. It uses scenery's `clipArea` feature to provide the
illusion of cards are being dragged through the builder.

[SeeInsideLayer](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/SeeInsideLayer.js)
uses scenery's `clipArea` and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) features to provide the illusion of being able to "see
inside" the builder. All instances of CardNode are descendants of this node, and thus visible when they pass a window.

[SceneNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/SceneNode.js) and its subtypes display
a scene. Each screen has 1 or more scenes. If a screen has more than 1 scene, it also has a control for selecting a
scene (see
[SceneRadioButtonGroup](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/SceneRadioButtonGroup.js)).

**Carousels and containers**: Cards and functions are not put directly into carousels. Rather, cards and functions are
put into *containers*, which are then put into the carousels. See
[MovableContainer](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/containers/MovableContainer.js)
and its subtypes.
[CardContainer](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/containers/CardContainer.js)
has responsibility for creating the model and view of cards.
[FunctionContainer](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/containers/FunctionContainer.js)
has responsibility for creating the model and view of functions.

**Drawers**: A drawer is a user-interface component for showing/hiding a feature. Drawers appear on the top and bottom
edges of the builder in scenes that involve mathematical functions.
[MathSceneNode](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/view/MathSceneNode.js)
optionally adds drawers for these 3 features:

* Table - a table of input and output values
* Graph - a graph of (x,y) points and the line that represents the functions in the builder
* Equation - equation (in 2 forms) that represents the functions in the builder

**Animation**: The view is responsible only for fading between scenes (using Tween.js). All other animation is the
responsibility of the model
(see `step` in [FBMovable](https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/main/js/common/model/Movable.js)).

**Mystery screen notes**: The Mystery screen was added late in the development process. This had a few unfortunate (but
not tragic) consequences for its implementation, which are worth describing here. The Mystery screen has 3 scenes, but (
unlike the other screens) it has no function carousel. The function carousel is deeply ingrained in the architecture of
scenes, and couldn't be removed without a great deal of redesign and destablization. So in order to reuse what had been
done for other screens, the function carousel exists in the Mystery scenes, but is made invisible. And while the
function carousel is invisible, it continues to play an important role, as a source of functions. The function carousel
is populated with enough functions to handle all challenges. When a challenge is generated, functions are moved between
the (invisible) carousel and the builder, and the functions are configured to match the challenge. Had this screen been
included from the beginning, this is *not* how things would have been implemented. But this solution does work well, and
is not unreasonably complicated to understand.
