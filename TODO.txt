TODO list for function-builder

Create cards and functions after empty carousel are realized.

Is it better to have 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends MovableNode' and decorate with ImageFunctionNode,
or should it be 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends ImageFunctionNode' with mixin MovableHandler?

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
