TODO list for function-builder

Set default animation speed in FunctionNode and CardNode

Document @params

Add arrows to move cards to next/previous window. Does this interfere with Equation drawer?

Flush cards out of builder when 'see inside' is turned off (account for Reset All).
  If we don't do this, then 'mole cards' will need to be draggable, which is a big deal.

Reset All doesn't handle cards that are paused in 'see inside' windows.

Equations screen is a more general form of Numbers screen. In Equations, functions are dynamic,

Investigate different approach to NumberFunction subtypes, include some form of operator precedence to support equations

Double functions for Numbers screen

Set maxWidth for labels on CheckBoxes, instead of CheckBoxes.

Move view-related stuff (locationProperty, slots, animation, ...) out of model?

Should 'see inside' windows be added dynamically, and only where there's a function?

Reset All doesn't work for things that the user is dragging
