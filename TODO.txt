TODO list for function-builder

BUG: Function that is replaced by another function in the builder is not pushed to the function carousel.

Movable.destination is private, but still used in Builder, replace with animateTo.

Builder: function is put in slot in model before animation to slot completes

Re-parent functions to builder?

Bare bones slider apparatus on builder.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
