TODO list for function-builder

QUESTIONS

Mystery screen: design

Table:
- this feature seems redundant, input/output carousels are effectively a table, what is the table adding?
- potentially confusing, due to different ordering than carousel?
- relatively expensive to implement
- Confirm the specification: Once an input enters the builder it appears in the table under “In”. After
it exits the builder and flies to the output panel the output value will appear in the table under “Out”.
- When is an entry removed from the table? When it's removed from the output carousel? Returned to the input carousel? Never?
- When an entry is removed from the table, do all rows below it move up?
- If an entry is remove when it’s card is removed from the output carousel, then clicking on a card and immediately releasing it will move the table row to the end of the table. That seems potentially confusing.
- How important is highlighting by selecting rows in table? What happens when the corresponding item in the carousel is not visible? Does the corresponding point on graph also need to highlight? How does highlighting work for multi-touch?

DECISIONS

Equations:
- Cards always show simplified form
- simplified form === slope-intercept
- see rtf for "helpful" form (unsimplified)
- Use script for x and y symbols (see Expression Exchange)

Graph:
- Graph will use max scale [-100,100] to start, so we can understand the issues
- Point is added to graph when put in output carousel
- Point is removed from graph when removed from output carousel

Better way to specify functions in NumbersScene and EquationsScene

Better pattern for ghost cards

Reset All
- doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows
- doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating
