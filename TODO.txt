TODO list for function-builder

ImageCard.containerLocation is incorrect, see console.log in ImageCardContainerNode.adjustInitialLocations

Replace Movable.containerLocation with adjustment of Movable.locationProperty.initialValue

Is it better to have 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends MovableNode' and decorate with ImageFunctionNode,
or should it be 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends ImageFunctionNode' with mixin MovableHandler?

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
