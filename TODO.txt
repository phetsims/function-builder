TODO list for function-builder

Move locationProperty to view?

Move responsibility for re-parenting into ImageCardNode and ImageFunctionNode, instead of using closures in
  ImageCardContainerNode and ImageFunctionContainerNode.

Do all drag handling in MovableNode subtypes, instead of having to duplicate or forward in containers.

Consider these constructors, which identify the possible parent nodes for a card/function:
ImageCardNode( card, inputCarousel, outputCarousel, worldParent )
ImageFunctionNode( card, carousel, builderNode, worldParent )

Re-parent functions to builder?

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
