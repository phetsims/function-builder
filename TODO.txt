TODO list for function-builder

Reset All
- broken for functions and cards
- implement erase button at same time, it's similar

Builder:
- function that is replaced by another function in the builder is not added to the function carousel
- Movable.destination is private, but still used in Builder, replace with animateTo.
- function is put in slot in model before animation to slot completes
- re-parent functions to BuilderNode

Bare bones slider apparatus on builder.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
