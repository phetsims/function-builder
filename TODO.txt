Change requests

Mystery screen:
- pool of predefined function combinations (operator, operand)
- implement "generate" button listener
- assign function colors randomly
- MysteryFunctionNode that has a default label of '?', optional label can be specified, mutable fill, syncs with model operand, supports 'show answer'
- MysteryFunctionContainer
- MysterySceneNode has much in common with EquationSceneNode

Write model.md

Write implementation-notes.md

DESIGN

Do we really want negative operands for plus and minus operators? (Equations and Mystery screens)

function combinations for the Mystery screen (negative operands for plus and minus, adjacent operators of the same type, first function in each “pool”)

“Hide Functions” check box on Mystery screen - Do we want it? Should it have a different icon on the button?

Now that we're using scene buttons in Mystery screen, should Patterns screen use a 3-function scene button?

Is the background color OK for the Mystery screen?
