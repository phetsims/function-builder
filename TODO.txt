TODO list for function-builder

Change pattern used for items in carousels.

Is it better to have 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends MovableNode' and decorate with ImageFunctionNode,
or should it be 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends ImageFunctionNode' with mixin MovableHandler?

Consider making 'double functions' occupy 1 slot.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.
