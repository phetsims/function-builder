TODO list for function-builder

---

Design issues: (email AG & AP)
- format of unsimplified and simplified equations
- grammar: in/out vs input/output in Numbers screen
- necessity of table feature
- specification and placement of eyeball switch

Propose ditching the in/out table; it's redundant, potentially confusing, and would provide more space for graph

Propose ditching double functions; they appear only in Numbers screen (a scaffolding screen), and the same things
  can be accomplished with single functions

When do points appear on graph?

Rational numbers in model and view, https://github.com/peterolson/BigRational.js

Better way to specify functions in NumbersScene and EquationsScene

Complete view of double functions, may need to make all functions wider to prevent overlap with 'See Inside' windows

How to handle 'x' card in Equations screen?
    Can't apply the functions, need to build an equation based on a set of functions.
    What equation form is supposed to display in output carousel? in 'See Inside' windows?

How to handle 'A' and 'B' functions in Equations screen? And why are they necessary?

Equations and Numbers model elements should be identical, only the view is different

Move 'See Inside' check box closer to builder, replace with icon on/off switch?

Reset All
- doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows
- doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating
