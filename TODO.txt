TODO list for function-builder

Cards:
- update model and view when functions change
- update view when location changes

Reset All
- broken for functions and cards
- implement erase button at same time, it's similar

Bare bones slider apparatus on builder.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
