TODO list for function-builder

Split MovableCreatorNode into separate types for model and view?

Rename (eg) ImageCardCreatedListener to ImageCardManager, and handle all aspects of lifecycle?

Move cards[] and functionInstances[] from PatternsScene to their respective manager types?

Is it better to have 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends MovableNode' and decorate with ImageFunctionNode,
or should it be 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends ImageFunctionNode' with mixin MovableHandler?
