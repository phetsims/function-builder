TODO list for function-builder

test on iPad2

constrain to 1 card "parked" in the builder at a time #44

make FunctionNode and CardNode responsible for constraining contentNode to fit

write model.md

write implementation-notes.md

code review

warts:
- how content node is passed to CardNode by subtypes, but some subtypes mutate while others replace
- CardNode doesn't handle scaling content to card
- FunctionNode doesn't handle scaling content to card
- CardNode.createGhostNode and subtype implementations could have options out of sync with CardNode instantiation
- Builder and BuilderNode have overlapping responsibilities for slot management
- Card doesn't have an responsibility for what's displayed on it
