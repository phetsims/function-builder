TODO list for function-builder

---

DESIGN

Equations:
- specify format of unsimplified and simplified equations
- what is shown in 'See Inside' window?
- does output carousel always show simplified form?
- where to put sign on slope?

Is 'Simplified' the proper label for the check box? The specification seems to want expanded form in some cases.

Drawers:
- arrows or grippers on drawer handles?
- small font on function icons in Numbers screen due to double functions and 'See Inside' windows

A and B mystery functions filling in Equations screen
- Are they needed in this screen?
- They complicate implementation because they are totally different than the other functions in the carousel.
- They are labeled 'A' and 'B', different than '?' style used in Numbers screen, how will the student know
  that they are double functions?
- They aren't much of a mystery if once you run 'x' through them, since you'll see the equation in the output.

Grammar: In/Out are not nouns

Revisit the 'table' feature. It's redundant (input/output carousels are effectively a table), potentially confusing
because ordering is different, relatively expensive to implement.

Revisit double functions. They appear only in Numbers screen (a scaffolding screen), and the same things
can be accomplished with single functions

Revisit necessity of the eyeball switch feature.
- What is the goal, is there another way to do the same thing?
- specification and placement of switch

Table:
- Confirm the specification: Once an input enters the builder it appears in the table under “In”. After
  it exits the builder and flies to the output panel the output value will appear in the table under “Out”.
- When is an entry removed from the table? When it's removed from the output carousel?
- When a card is removed from the output carousel, is its entry in the table removed? Clicking on a card and
  immediately releasing it will move the table row to the end
- When an entry is removed from the table, do all rows below it move up?
- How important is highlighting by selecting rows in table? What happens when the corresponding item in
  the carousel is not visible? Will this be confusing?

Graph:
- When does a point appear on graph? When card is in the output carousel?
- When are points removed from the graph? When card is removed from the output carousel?

Rational numbers in model and view, https://github.com/peterolson/BigRational.js

Better way to specify functions in NumbersScene and EquationsScene

Complete view of double functions, may need to make all functions wider to prevent overlap with 'See Inside' windows

How to handle 'x' card in Equations screen?
    Can't apply the functions, need to build an equation based on a set of functions.
    What equation form is supposed to display in output carousel? in 'See Inside' windows?

How to handle 'A' and 'B' functions in Equations screen? And why are they necessary?

Equations and Numbers model elements should be identical, only the view is different

Move 'See Inside' check box closer to builder, replace with icon on/off switch?

Number vs Numbers prefix on .js files

Equation vs Equations prefix on .js files

Reset All
- doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows
- doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating
