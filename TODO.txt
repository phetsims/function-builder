TODO list for function-builder

Change pattern used for items in carousels:
- set correct container locations on startup
- set correct function locations on startup
- delete Movable.containerNode
- fix PatternsScene.reset
- delete unused types in patterns.view
- implement similar pattern for input cards carousel

Is it better to have 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends MovableNode' and decorate with ImageFunctionNode,
or should it be 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends ImageFunctionNode' with mixin MovableHandler?

Consider making 'double functions' occupy 1 slot.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- spy glass (finger obscures spyglass)
- dragging through builder vs animating through builder (will students discover these?)
