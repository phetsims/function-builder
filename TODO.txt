Discuss with AP:

âœ“ BigRational (BigRat)
- unsimplified and simplified equations (email AG & AP)
- in/out vs input/output in Numbers screen
- table (email AG & AP, mini design meeting)
- double functions (reduce space)
- move 'Simplify Equation' check box into equation drawer? (yes)
- placement of eyeball switch (clarify spec with AG)

Double functions for Numbers screen
