TODO list for function-builder

Firefox, built version startup: InvalidStateError: An attempt was made to use an object that is not, or is no longer, usable

Factor drag behavior out of CardNode and FunctionNode, move to their own type.

Make cards stop at 'see inside' windows when animating, add arrows to move to next/previous window.

Flush cards out of builder when 'see inside' is turned off (account for Reset All).

Handle non-invertible functions

Two functions may be animating towards the same slot, causing an assertion failure when the 2nd function arrives.

Move view-related stuff (locationProperty, slots, animation, ...) out of model?

Should 'see inside' windows be added dynamically, and only where there's a function?

Reset All doesn't work for things that the user is dragging

Vertical seam visible at left or right edge of clipArea for BuilderNode

How to keep functions with spinners from popping out of the carousel and builder?
