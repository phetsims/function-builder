TODO list for function-builder

While card is animating, it needs to check state of seeInsideProperty, so it stops at visible windows.
  May need to add @param {function} [stepCallback] to Movable.animateTo.

While card is animating to left, it needs to check continuously for non-invertible functions, since
  functions in builder may change while card is animating, #24.

Flush cards out of builder when 'see inside' is turned off (account for Reset All).
  If we don't do this, then 'mole cards' will need to be draggable, which is a big deal.

Add arrows to move cards to next/previous window. Does this interfere with Equation drawer?

Equations screen is a more general form of Numbers screen. In Equations, functions are dynamic,
outputs may be fractions, adds a graph.

Investigate different approach to NumberFunction subtypes, include some form of operator precedence to support equations

Double functions for Numbers screen

Document function @params

Set maxWidth for labels on CheckBoxes, instead of CheckBoxes.

Move view-related stuff (locationProperty, slots, animation, ...) out of model?

Should 'see inside' windows be added dynamically, and only where there's a function?

Reset All doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows.

Reset All doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating.
