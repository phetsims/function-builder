TODO list for function-builder

constrain to 1 card "parked" in the builder at a time #44

implementation warts:
- use the FunctionCreator pattern for Cards
- contentNode is passed to CardNode by subtypes, some subtypes mutate it, while others replace it
- CardNode doesn't handle scaling contentNode to card
- FunctionNode doesn't handle scaling contentNode or hiddenNode to card
- CardNode.createGhostNode and subtype implementations could have options and scaling out of sync with CardNode instances
- Builder and BuilderNode know nothing about cards; cards are never really "in" the builder or its windows
