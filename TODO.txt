TODO list for function-builder

---
Discuss with AP:

âœ“ BigRational (BigRat)
- unsimplified and simplified equations (email AG & AP)
- in/out vs input/output in Numbers screen
- table (email AG & AP, mini design meeting)
- double functions (reduce space)
- move 'Simplify Equation' check box into equation drawer? (yes)
- placement of eyeball switch (clarify spec with AG)

---

Specify format of unsimplified and simplified equations

Dynamic functions

Equations screen is a more general form of Numbers screen. In Equations, functions are dynamic,
outputs may be fractions, adds a graph.

In/Out table

Double functions for Numbers screen

---

Propose ditching the in/out table; it's redundant, potentially confusing, and would provide more space for graph

Propose ditching double functions; they appear only in Numbers screen (a scaffolding screen), and the same things
  can be accomplished with single functions

Reset All
- doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows
- doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating

How to keep functions with spinners from popping out of the carousel and builder?
