TODO list for function-builder

---
Discuss with AP:

- BigRational
- unsimplified and simplified equations
- in/out vs input/output in Numbers screen
- table
- double functions
- move 'Simplify Equation' check box into equation drawer?
- placement of eyeball switch

---

Specify format of unsimplified and simplified equations

Dynamic functions

Equations screen is a more general form of Numbers screen. In Equations, functions are dynamic,
outputs may be fractions, adds a graph.

In/Out table

Double functions for Numbers screen

---

Propose ditching the in/out table; it's redundant, potentially confusing, and would provide more space for graph

Propose ditching double functions; they appear only in Numbers screen (a scaffolding screen), and the same things
  can be accomplished with single functions
