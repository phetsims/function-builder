TODO list for function-builder

---

Design issues: (email AG & AP)
- format of unsimplified and simplified equations
- grammar: in/out vs input/output in Numbers screen
- necessity of table feature
- specification and placement of eyeball switch

Propose ditching the in/out table; it's redundant, potentially confusing, and would provide more space for graph

Propose ditching double functions; they appear only in Numbers screen (a scaffolding screen), and the same things
  can be accomplished with single functions

Dynamically set 'invertible' for 'times' function, invertible = ( operand !== 0 );

How to handle 'x' card in Equations screen?

How to handle 'A' and 'B' functions in Equations screen? And why are they necessary?

Complete view of double functions, may need to make all functions wider to prevent overlap with 'See Inside' windows

Rational numbers in model and view

Move 'See Inside' check box closer to builder, replace with icon on/off switch?

Reset All
- doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows
- doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating
