TODO list for function-builder

Split builder into foreground and background, to give illusion of dragging cards through it.

Cards:
- update model and view when functions change
- update view when location changes

Bare bones slider apparatus on builder.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Reset All doesn't work for things that the user is dragging

Usability:
- How to keep functions that are mutable from popping out of the carousel and builder?
