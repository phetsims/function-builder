TODO list for function-builder

implementation warts:
- use the FunctionCreator pattern for Cards
- FunctionNode doesn't handle scaling contentNode or hiddenNode to card
- CardNode.createGhostNode and subtype implementations could have options and scaling out of sync with CardNode instances
- Builder and BuilderNode know nothing about cards; cards are never really "in" the builder or its windows
