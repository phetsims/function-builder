TODO list for function-builder

---

Design issues: (email AG & AP)
- format of unsimplified and simplified equations
- grammar: in/out vs input/output in Numbers screen
- necessity of table feature
- specification and placement of eyeball switch

---

Flesh out basic functionality of Equations screen

Double functions for Numbers screen, may need to make functions wider

Specify format of unsimplified and simplified equations

Dynamic functions

In/Out table

Move 'Simplify Equation' check box into equation drawer

Move 'See Inside' check box closer to builder, replace with icon on/off switch?

---

Propose ditching the in/out table; it's redundant, potentially confusing, and would provide more space for graph

Propose ditching double functions; they appear only in Numbers screen (a scaffolding screen), and the same things
  can be accomplished with single functions

Reset All
- doesn't handle cards that are being dragged, animating or paused in 'see inside' windows
- doesn't handle functions that are being dragged or animating

Vertical seam visible at left or right edge of clipArea for BuilderNode

How to keep functions with spinners from popping out of the carousel and builder?
