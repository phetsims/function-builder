TODO list for function-builder

Factor out eraserButtonListener (PatternsSceneNode), use in Reset All.

Cards:
- update model and view when functions change
- update view when location changes

Reset All
- broken for functions, cards

Bare bones slider apparatus on builder.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Usability:
- How to keep functions that are mutable from popping out of the carousel and builder?
