TODO list for function-builder

Cards:
- add CardNode base type
- update model and view when functions change
- update view when location changes

Reset All
- broken for functions, cards
- implement erase button at same time, it's similar

Bare bones slider apparatus on builder.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.


Usability:
- How to keep functions that are mutable from popping out of the carousel and builder?
