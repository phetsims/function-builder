Change requests

Mystery screen:
- pool of predefined function combinations
- SceneNode customizations (hidden function carousel, no hideFunctionsCheckBox, enabled/disable seeInsideCheckBox)
- implement "generate" button listener
- assign function colors randomly
- "See Inside" check box enabled when all cards have been dragged to output carousel?
- "Show functions" button?

Do we really want negative operands for the plus and minus operators?
