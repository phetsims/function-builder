TODO list for function-builder

Use separate layers for animating cards and functions, with pickable:false, so they can't be grabbed.

Take popout into account when computing drag path for cards

Make cards stop at 'see inside' windows when animating

Apply 'layer' pattern to 'mole' feature and other things?

Update card when location changes or Builder.functionChangedEmitter.emit

Disable erase button if there's nothing in the output carousel

Should 'see inside' windows be added dynamically, and only where there's a function?

---

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.

Move function to adjacent empty slot instead of returning to carousel.

Reset All doesn't work for things that the user is dragging

Vertical seam visible at left or right edge of clipArea for BuilderNode

Usability:
- How to keep functions that are mutable from popping out of the carousel and builder?
