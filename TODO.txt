TODO list for function-builder

Is it better to have 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends MovableNode' and decorate with ImageFunctionNode,
or should it be 'MovableImageFunctionNode extends ImageFunctionNode' with mixin MovableHandler?

Consider making 'double functions' occupy 1 slot.

Need a way to pre-populate output carousel with 1 card of each type for testing convenience.
